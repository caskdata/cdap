/**
 * The Cask360Table Dataset Interface.
 * <p>
 * Used to store and aggregate data for a set of entities from multiple sources.
 * Each entity and entity update are represented as a {@link Cask360Entity}.
 * <p>
 * Table implements a "wide row" three-dimension data model:
 * <pre>
 *   {
 *     Entity1 --> {
 *                   Group  --> { Key --> Value , Key2 --> Value2 , ... } ,
 *                   Group2 --> { Key3 --> Value3 , ... } ,
 *                   GroupT --> [{'time'-->Timestamp10,'value'-->Value},{'time'-->Timestamp9,'value'-->Value2},...],
 *                   ...
 *                 } ,
 *     Entity2 --> {
 *                   Group  --> { Key --> ValueA , KeyX --> ValueX , ... } ,
 *                   GroupY --> { KeyA --> Value B , ... } ,
 *                   Group4 --> [{'time'-->Timestamp8,'value'-->ValueN},{'time'-->Timestamp3,'value'-->Value3},...],
 *                   ...
 *                 } ,
 *     ...
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * That is, the table stores a set of Entities, uniquely represented by an ID.
 * Each Entity can contain one or more Groups of data. Each Group of data has a
 * name and a type. The following are the types of Groups supported:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Map</b> is a sorted map of string keys to string values</li>
 * <li><b>Time</b> is a sorted list of long timestamps to string values</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * There are no hard limits on the number of entities, groups, key-values. As a
 * general guideline, this table can easily scale to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Hundreds of Groups per Entity</li>
 * <li>Thousands of Key-Values per Entity</li>
 * <li>Billions of Entities (limited by cluster size)</li>
 * </ul>
 * There are no limits or restrictions about the existence of the same groups in
 * different entities. Each entity could have completely distinct groups,
 * although this is not a common pattern. However, it may be common that some
 * entities may have a group that others do not, which is also permitted. For
 * example, in the above <b>Entity1</b> and <b>Entity2</b> both contain data for
 * <b>Group</b> but one contains data for <b>Group2</b> and the other for
 * <b>GroupY</b>.
 * <p>
 * The SQL Table schema exposed by this dataset flattens the nested structure
 * into a six column schema of <b>(id, group, type, time, key, value)</b> as
 * defined in {@link Cask360Record}.
