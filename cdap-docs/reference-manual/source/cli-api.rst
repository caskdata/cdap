============================================
Command-Line Interface API
============================================

Introduction
============

The Command-Line Interface (CLI) provides methods to interact with the CDAP server from within a shell,
similar to HBase shell or ``bash``. It is located within the SDK, at ``bin/cdap-cli`` as either a bash
script or a Windows ``.bat`` file.

The CLI may be used in two ways: interactive mode and non-interactive mode.

Interactive Mode
----------------

.. highlight:: console

To run the CLI in interactive mode, run the ``cdap-cli.sh`` executable with no arguments from the terminal::

  $ /bin/cdap-cli.sh

or, on Windows::

  ~SDK> bin\cdap-cli.bat

The executable should bring you into a shell, with this prompt::

  cdap (http://localhost:10000)>

This indicates that the CLI is currently set to interact with the CDAP server at ``localhost``.
There are two ways to interact with a different CDAP server:

- To interact with a different CDAP server by default, set the environment variable ``CDAP_HOST`` to a hostname.
- To change the current CDAP server, run the command ``connect example.com``.
- To connect to an SSL-enabled CDAP server, run the command ``connect https://example.com``.

For example, with ``CDAP_HOST`` set to ``example.com``, the CLI would be interacting with
a CDAP instance at ``example.com``, port ``10000``::

  cdap (http://example.com:10000)>

To list all of the available commands, enter ``help``::

  cdap (http://localhost:10000)> help

Non-Interactive Mode
--------------------

To run the CLI in non-interactive mode, run the ``cdap-cli.sh`` executable, passing the command you want executed
as the argument. For example, to list all applications currently deployed to CDAP, execute::

  cdap-cli.sh list apps

Connecting to Secure CDAP Instances
-----------------------------------

When connecting to secure CDAP instances, the CLI will look for an access token located at
~/.cdap.accesstoken.<hostname> and use it if it exists and is valid. If not, the CLI will prompt
you for the required credentials to acquire an access token from the CDAP instance. Once acquired,
the CLI will save it to ~/.cdap.accesstoken.<hostname> for later use and use it for the rest of
the current CLI session.
