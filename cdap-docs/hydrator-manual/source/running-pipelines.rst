Running Pipelines
=================


Pipeline can be started, stopped, and controlled using:

- :ref:`Cask Hydrator UI <cask-hydrator-running-pipelines-within-hydrator>`
- :ref:`CDAP UI <cdap-ui>`
- :ref:`CDAP CLI <cdap-cli>`
- Command line tools, using the :ref:`Lifecycle HTTP RESTful API <http-restful-api-lifecycle-start>`

Running a Pipeline within Hydrator
==================================
From within Hydrator, you can start and stop pipelines. 

For a batch pipeline, you can start or stop ("suspend") its schedule. It will then begin
at the next scheduled time. (To change the schedule requires creating a new pipeline with
a new schedule.)

For a real-time pipeline, you simply start or stop the pipeline.

You can view details of a pipeline, such as its configuration, settings, stages, schemas, etc.

Logs
====
As pipelines run, they create entries in the CDAP logs.

Logs for a pipeline can be obtained using the same tools as any other CDAP application and
program, and are described in the :ref:`Administration manual, Logging and Monitoring
<logging-monitoring>` and the :ref:`Logging HTTP RESTful API <http-restful-api-logging>`.

Script transform steps can write to logs, as described in the section in developing
plugins on :ref:`script transformations
<cask-hydrator-creating-a-plugin-script-transformations>`.


Metrics
=======
As pipelines run, they create both system and user metrics.

System metrics for a pipeline can be obtained using the same tools as any other CDAP
application and program, and are described in the :ref:`Administration manual, metrics
<operations-metrics>` and the :ref:`Metrics HTTP RESTful API <http-restful-api-metrics>`.

Script transform steps can create metrics, as described in the section in developing
plugins on :ref:`script transformations
<cask-hydrator-creating-a-plugin-script-transformations>`.

For instance, if you have a real-time pipeline named "demoPipeline" with three stages
(*DataGenerator*, *JavaScript*, and *Table*), then you can discover the available metrics
using a `curl` command, such as (reformatted for display):

  .. tabbed-parsed-literal::

    $ curl -w"\n" -X POST "http://localhost:10000/v3/metrics/search?target=metric&tag=namespace:default&tag=app:demoPipeline"

    ["system.app.log.debug","system.app.log.info","system.app.log.warn","system.dataset.
    store.bytes","system.dataset.store.ops","system.dataset.store.reads","system.dataset.
    store.writes","system.metrics.emitted.count","user.DataGenerator.records.out","user.
    JavaScript.record.count","user.JavaScript.records.in","user.JavaScript.records.out","
    user.Table.records.in","user.Table.records.out","user.metrics.emitted.count"]
  
In this case, the user metric *"user.JavaScript.record.count"* was incremented in the JavaScript stage using::

  context.getMetrics().count('record.count', 1);
  
The value of the metric can be retrieved with:

  .. tabbed-parsed-literal::

    $ curl -w"\n" -X POST "localhost:10000/v3/metrics/query?tag=namespace:default&tag=app:etlRealtime6&metric=user.JavaScript.record.count&aggregate=true"

    {"startTime":0,"endTime":1468884338,"series":[{"metricName":"user.JavaScript.record.
    count","grouping":{},"data":[{"time":0,"value":170}]}],"resolution":"2147483647s"}

Using the CDAP CLI, you can retrieve the value with:

  .. tabbed-parsed-literal::
    :tabs: "CDAP CLI"
 
    |cdap >| get metric value user.JavaScript.record.count 'app=demoPipeline'
 
    Start time: 0
    End time: 1468884640
