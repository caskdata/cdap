- `Plugin Presentation: <#plugin-presentation>`__ controlling how your plugin appears in the Hydrator Studio
- `Plugin Deployment: <#deploying-a-system-artifact>`__ deploying as either a system or user *artifact*
- `Deployment Verification: <#deployment-verification>`__ verifying an artifact was added successfully

If you are installing a **third-party JAR** (such as a **JDBC driver**) to make it accessible to other

Deploying Third-Party JARs
==========================

.. highlight:: json  

**Prebuilt JARs:** In a case where you'd like to use pre-built third-party JARs (such as a
JDBC driver) as a plugin, you will need to create a JSON file to describe the JAR.

For information on the format of the JSON, please refer to the sections on
:ref:`Third-Party Plugins <plugins-third-party>` and :ref:`Plugin Deployment <plugins-deployment>`.

A sample JDBC Driver Plugin configuration:

.. container:: highlight

  .. parsed-literal::
  
    {
      "parents": [ "cdap-etl-batch[|version|,\ |version|]" ],
      "plugins": [
        {
          "name" : "mysql",
          "type" : "jdbc",
          "className" : "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver",
          "description" : "Plugin for MySQL JDBC driver"
        },
        {
          "name" : "postgresql",
          "type" : "jdbc",
          "className" : "org.postgresql.Driver",
          "description" : "Plugin for PostgreSQL JDBC driver"
        }
