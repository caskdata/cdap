Cask Data Application Platform Example
======================================

This ``example`` directory contains an example app for the Cask Data Application Platform
(CDAP). Detailed information about this example is available at the Cask documentation website:

  http://docs.cask.co/cdap/current/en/examples-manual/examples/index.html

A complete list of example applications is available in the parent directory.


Building
========

The example comes with a Maven pom.xml file. To build, install Maven, and from the
directory prompt, enter::

  mvn clean package


Summary of Application
======================

Purchase
--------
- An app that uses a scheduled Workflow to start a MapReduce that reads from one ObjectStore 
  Dataset and writes to another. The app also demonstrates using ad-hoc SQL queries, the
  RESTful interface of a Service, and custom Datasets.

  - Send sentences of the form "Tom bought 5 apples for $10" to the purchaseStream.
  - The PurchaseFlow reads the purchaseStream and converts every input String into a
    Purchase object and stores the object in the purchases Dataset.
  - When scheduled by the PurchaseHistoryWorkFlow, the PurchaseHistoryBuilder MapReduce
    program reads the purchases Dataset, creates a purchase history, and stores the purchase
    history in the history Dataset every morning at 4:00 A.M. You can manually (in the
    Process screen in the CDAP Console) or programmatically execute the 
    PurchaseHistoryBuilder MapReduce to store customers' purchase history in the
    history Dataset.
  - Request the ``PurchaseHistoryService`` retrieve from the *history* Dataset the purchase 
    history of a user.
  - You can use SQL to formulate ad-hoc queries over the history Dataset. This is done by
    a series of ``curl`` calls, as described in the RESTful API section of the Developers'
    Manual.

  - Note: Because by default the PurchaseHistoryWorkFlow process doesn't run until 4:00 A.M.,
    you'll have to wait until the next day (or manually or programmatically execute the
    PurcaseHistoryBuilder) after entering the first customers' purchases or the PurchaseQuery
    will return a "not found" error.
