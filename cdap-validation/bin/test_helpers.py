                              CDAP Validation Tool

    Its purpose is to check A Hadoop or CDAP cluster for its CDAP readiness.
    It is designed in a modular way (validation modules are pluggable).
    Configurations, service checks, etc are gathered via the Hadoop Manager's API.
    These are stored and made available to the validation modules.
    Three pluggable modules are provided with this tool:
    * Configuration Validation
    * Service Checks -- coming soon
    * Cluster Layout checks -- coming soon

# The following function is needed for Cloudera Manager and other configs that require config API calls based on lists
#   of services, retrieved through another API call.
# In order to programmatically retrieve certain configurations via API, Cloudera manager requires at least two
#   and in many cases three or four API calls, each dependent on information retrieved in the previous one or ones.
#
# Here is an example that only requires three API calls, to obtain a specific configuration file
# To get the contents of the hdfs-site.xml on the namenode, we would need to do:
#  * GET /api/v10/cm/deployment
#  * Find the namenode value e.g. hdfs-NAMENODE-cd4bc7dac120e30f653e076328de207d, in the config obtained with previous call
#  * GET /api/v10/clusters/<cluster>/serviceTypes
#  * iterate through the list of services (to verify service exists) from the serviceTypes call, and for each service:
#    - Using the value obtained from the first API call and from the second API call, run an API call that would look like:
#    GET /api/v10/clusters/<cluster>/services/hdfs/roles/hdfs-NAMENODE-cd4bc7dac120e30f653e076328de207d/process/configFiles/hdfs-site.xml
#
# To find and iterate through all configurations needed, we need to make the following API calls and extraction
#  * GET /api/v10/cm/deployment
#  * GET /api/v10/clusters/<cluster>/serviceTypes
#  * then for every service found in serviceType:
#    - GET /api/v10/clusters/<cluster>/services/<service>/config?view=full
#    - GET /api/v10/clusters/<cluster>/services/<service>/roleTypes
#    - then for every role found in roleTypes find and make all API calls that use roles (such as the example above)
